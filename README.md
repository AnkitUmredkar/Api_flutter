# What is API?
## API (Application Programming Interface):

- API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable developers to use predefined methods to interact with other software or services without needing to understand their internal workings.

## How do APIs work?
- API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, the bureauâ€™s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client.
